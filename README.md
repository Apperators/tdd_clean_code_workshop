# tdd_clean_code_workshop

Hello Apperator. This is Typescript repo contains a few prompts designed to help more junior devs or those not familiar with test driven development get experience with TDD.

## Pre-Reqs
* Node (recommended version 15+)
* An IDE of some sort (recommended VSCode)

## How to Use
1) Either fork and pull or just pull the code down
2) Run ``npm i`` to install all necessary packages.
3) Go through ``/src/TDD_Practice_Examples/`` and work each prompt following strict TDD. The prompts stair step from simple to more complex (though none
of the prompts are necessarily super difficult).

**This "workshop" is most effective with a guide, a developer whom is knowledgeable in TDD, Clean Code, and refactoring.**
